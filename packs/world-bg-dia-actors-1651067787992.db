Stirges resemble nothing more than a slightly oversized bat crossed with a mosquito; however, upon closer inspection the Stirge reveals much more. Coated in greasy, pink flesh (save for a small tufted mane of white fur about its head and neck) the Stirge is equipped with a pair of small, bat-like wings made of stretched flesh between struts of thin bone. The skin here at the wing is so thin that light may easily shine through the beast's wings revealing the tiny vesicles within. Stirges also possess a set of six, spindly legs above their pig-like tail. Each leg is tipped with a set of hooked claws which allows the fiend to grip into the flesh of its prey and hang on should a struggle ensue. However, there is one more feature that makes the Stirge truly repugnant.</p>\n<p><strong>What's Your Type?</strong> Stirges are notable for their ravenous desire to consume the blood of living organisms. These beasts accomplish this foul act with aid from the needle-sharp proboscis waiting at the end of its oversized snout. Gifted with the ability of flight, the Stirge dives down upon an unsuspecting enemy and clamps onto their body with the aid of their barbed claws. The Stirge then drives its proboscis into their victim's flesh, sucking out ounce after ounce of warm blood. Only when the Stirge is sufficiently sated (or battered away) will it release its victim to flee into the darkness where it may digest its liquid lunch.

little runts… they ambushed us on the trail before we’d even been made aware we’d entered their “king’s” territory.  They attacked from out of the bushes like a tidal wave of bodies crashing into our cart, all the while gibbering in their foul, snarl of a tongue.  We should have been prepared for them, I recall their weaponry was so poor one bugger was swinging half a broom handle with a small iron spike driven through; nonetheless, they overwhelmed us with their surprise attack and made off with a hefty share of the camp’s rations for the next month.<br /><em>Captain Will Freidmont of the Upper Wilds Valdyrguard.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goblins are evil creatures of diminutive stature who exist in almost every corner of the natural world as a constant yet generally manageable threat.  Hailing from a group of creatures called goblinoids (which includes bugbears and hobgoblins), the goblin is a foul humanoid measuring no larger than the average halfling.  Goblins have skin tones varying from light clay to deep chestnut brown to a sickly, acidic green, their hair is thin and greasy, and within their jaws rest cracked and sharpened teeth.  Together with their foaming fellows, goblins form loose collectives or tribes so their power can stand pronounced in numbers.  The tribal life also allows for a crude caste system to erupt from the goblin’s chaotic politics.  All goblins have something to offer to the tribe, be they foragers, slavers, or warriors.  If they cannot contribute, they die.</p>\n<p><strong>We Live in a Society. </strong> Capricious to the last, goblins crave nothing more than power and domination of all others around them by any means (including those methods dangerous to the goblin).  Those goblins who possess enough might or cleverness may ascend to the rank of Goblin Boss and command a lair consisting of several dozens goblinoid fellows.  Should ambition prove overwhelming, the boss in rare cases may subjugate nearby lairs of rival goblinoids and crown themselves a Goblin Queen/King.  It has been documented that in one particular case, Queen Greld the Gutripper was able to enslave a camp containing hundreds of orcs, then laid siege to the city of Westerholt close by and sacked the entire city.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnash and Bite, Trick and Trap.</strong> Goblins maintain some of the most chaotic lairs within the known world, and to accomplish this the goblins require a plethora of slaves.  Not always willing to murder those they plunder, goblins and their kin are known slavers, spiriting away captured humans from merchant wagons to contruct their insidious dungeons.  WIthin a goblin lair is all manner of trap: tunnels leading nowhere, narrow passages no human could pass through, arrow slits, pits lined with spikes, and of course a multitude of alarms to warn the tribe of any impending danger.  Goblins utilize chaotic placement within their lairs to throw off intruders from their hard earned loot which is kept safe within the lair’s heart.</p>\n<p><strong>And They Dance About the Flames.</strong> Goblins, though commonly thought of as greedy and stupid, leave their chaotic tendancies behind when it comes to the structure of religious worship.  They are beholden in particular to The God of the Goblins, also called They Who Lurk Beneath, who acts as chief of all other gods to the goblinoids.  This god encourages acts of violence, blind cruelty, enslaving others, as well as war amongst the enemies of the goblins.  Goblin tribes will join together in times of worship to dance, perform rituals with blood and bone, build massive bonfires, and sew chaos throughout the lair all in devotion to their evil benefactor.  Goblins, fueled by the spirit of the revelry, will then be exceedingly aggressive and volatile for the days after, raging through the surrounding area to sate the thirst of their cruel god.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry

It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p><p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p><p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p><p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p><p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":20,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":[],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null}},"sort":4900000,"flags":{},"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/dnd5e/assets/icons/skills/blue_13.jpg","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"xRQDu0GrQB9EpCYM","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

This is the sound of the sahuagin hunting horn — a call to raid and battle. Coastal settlers refer to sahuagin as “sea devils,” for sahuagin have no compassion in them, slaughtering the crews of ships and decimating coastal villages.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Devils of the Deep.</strong></em> Sahuagin are a predatory, piscine race that ventures from the ocean’s black depths to hunt the creatures of the shallows and shore. Though they dwell in the deepest trenches of the ocean, sahuagin view the entire aquatic realm as their kingdom and the creatures in it as blood sport for their hunting parties.</p>\n<p>The self-styled rulers of sahuagin ocean domains are massive mutant males that grow second sets of arms. They are terrible foes in battle, and all sahuagin bow down before these powerful barons.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Way of the Shark.</strong></em> Sahuagin worship the shark god Sekolah. Only female sahuagin are deemed worthy of channeling the god’s power, and priestesses hold tremendous sway in sahuagin communities.</p>\n<p>Sahuagin are driven into a frenzy by the smell of fresh blood. As worshipers of Sekolah, they also have a special kinship with sharks, which they train as attack animals. Even untrained sharks recognize sahuagin as allies and don’t prey on them.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Elven Enmity.</strong></em> The sahuagin might control the oceans if not for the presence of their mortal enemies, the aquatic elves. Wars between the two races have raged for centuries across the coasts and seas of the world, disrupting maritime trade and drawing other races into the bloody conflict.</p>\n<p>So intense is sahuagin hatred for the aquatic elves that the sea devils have adapted to combat their ancient foes. A sahuagin born near enough to an aquatic elf community can enter the world as a malenti — a sahuagin that physically resembles an aquatic elf in every way. Sahuagin are prone to mutation, but whether this rare phenomenon is a result of the wars between the sahuagin and the aquatic elves — or whether it preceded or even began the conflict — none can say.</p>\n<p>The sahuagin put the malenti to good use as spies and assassins in aquatic elf cities and the societies of other creatures that pose a threat to sahuagin. The mere shadow of the malenti threat incites paranoia and suspicion among aquatic elves, whose resilience is weakened as the prelude to an actual sahuagin

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum⁠ but instead viewed an illusion⁠, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</p><p><strong>On Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p><p><strong>Off Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 281","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"inst"},"target":{"value":9,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":10,"long":0,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"1d100","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell","value":""},"level":7,"school":"con","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":false,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":true},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"sort":7100000,"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"pack":"dnd5e.spells","originalItemName":"Teleport"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-shared-compendium.spells.c3iIfVn0nd2Arx9C"}},"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/dnd5e/assets/icons/spells/runes-magenta-3.jpg","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}}],"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"fgFDoSxXJx3CigMr":3},"flags":{"dnd5e":{},"monsterMunch":{"url":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/arkhan-the-cruel","img":"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/6684/308/637000099535198696.png","tokenImg":"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/6684/306/637000099531663485.png","spellList":{"class":[],"pact":[],"atwill":[],"innate":[{"name":"animate dead","type":"day","value":"3"},{"name":"branding smite","type":"day","value":"3"},{"name":"revivify","type":"day","value":"3"},{"name":"geas","type":"day","value":"1"},{"name":"raise dead","type":"day","value":"1"}],"edgeCases":[{"name":"branding smite","type":"innate","edge":"at 4th level"}]}},"ddbimporter":{"id":416910,"entityTypeId":779871897,"creatureGroup":null,"creatureFlags":[]},"betterNpcSheet":{"sheet":{"height":881,"width":900},"editMode":false},"core":{"sourceId":"Actor.BU6iHIDGN2Rhllra"},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"Actor.BU6iHIDGN2Rhllra","hash":"d19f96153adfaf6f949b90bf959774e5fd9c3c53"},"cf":{"id":"temp_2tcdbt87ily"}}}

His only concerns are the stability and prosperity of Baldur’s Gate, and he doesn’t trust any of the other dukes or anyone in the Parliament of Peers to put the city’s interests before their own.</p>\n<p>Ravengard rose to grand duke on a platform largely backed by idealistic commoners and enemies of the other established dukes. While he won election handily, Ravengard has struggled in performing his duties, finding his hands tied at every turn by both overt and invisible bureaucracy. Despite this, he’s been a voice of reason and common sense on the Council of Four — if not the egalitarianism some hoped. He’s also proven largely resistant to scandal and corruption, though many of his fellow dukes and those in the Parliament of Peers still regularly outmaneuver him politically. One of his only obvious pleasures remains the surprise inspections he regularly visits upon the troops at Wyrm’s Rock.</p>\n<p>Ravengard was recently tricked into attending a diplomatic summit in Elturel, unaware that his political enemies in Baldur’s Gate orchestrated this meeting in a fiendish plot to remove him from power. In his absence, the Flaming Fist is leaderless, the council rudderless.</p>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral","race":null,"type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"","cr":5,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":1800},"source":"Baldur's

the magic of necromancy is utilized upon the preserved flesh of a humanoid, a zombie will rise to serve its dark master.  In much the same way that an animated skeleton is returned from the dead so too are zombies shunted back into this world.  While a skilled spellcaster may animate the dead and command the newly awakened, zombies may also rise in areas of the world saturated with necromantic energy.  In this situation, the zombies will not obey the command of a master, but roam aimlessly in a small area until they either find something to attack and consume or rot away into a pile of inanimate bones.  </p>\n<p><strong>Re: Your Brains.</strong> Zombies do retain quite a lot of their former selves in regards to their physical appearance.  Zombies will still show the wounds or disease scars which slew them upon reanimating.  The symptoms of decay will also be present as many freshly spawned zombies will be bloated, have patches of skin sloughing from their bodies, or even trailing entrails from exploded abdomens.  While a zombie may resemble the person they were before, there is nothing at work within the head except mindless hunger.  Zombies stumble through their existence in a perpetual state of mindlessness only able to heed their master’s orders.  This fact of the zombie’s mind makes them invaluable warriors for a necromancer in need.  Zombies are direct and will shamble off towards their quarry without so much as a second thought to their own safety.  It’s been noted that some zombies have walked through fires or pits of acid in order to reach their enemies.  Once they reach their target, zombies will pummel and bite at their enemy until either they or the enemy fall in the tussle.  Zombies may also wield weapons, though not cleverly; zombies will not be able to reclaim a weapon should they be disarmed as the lack of weapon will simply drive them to claw with their broken hands.  The magic which binds the zombie to the mortal plane is tricky to the uninitiated as well, so please be warned young adventurers!  Should you fell a zombie, be aware that the creature may not be fully dead for the second time; you should always be sure to wait and see if the beast attempts to rise once more before wandering deeper into the dungeon.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-size:13px\">\n<li

If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land, instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.</p><p>The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p><p><strong>Part Water.</strong> You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p><p><strong>Redirect Flow.</strong> You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.</p><p><strong>Whirlpool.</strong> This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall.

Crabs are uniquely robust little creatures often no larger than the palm of an adult human's hand, with eight segmented legs protruding from either side of its scallop-shaped carapace. This hardened chitin carapace is topped with two black eye stalks (not unlike those of a snail) through which the beast views our coastlines and oceans. It has been observed that some species of crab lack an armored shell and prefer to squat in the discarded shells of conchs. This gives the crab a rather clever and sturdy mobile home. Adorning the crabs ninth and tenth appendages near its tiny mouth are two massive claws, resembling those of a scorpion, with dull serrations marking the inner edge of each. The crab primarily utilizes these claws in its search for food, cracking open the shells of other tiny aquatic beasts or snipping off tiny pieces of undersea plant life to dine on.</p>\n</section>\n<p>While perhaps not the most dangerous companion a summoner could wish for, the crab's ability to breath both in the water and upon land makes the crustacean an ally brimming with utility. I advise caution, however, when first looking through your crab familiar's eyes, as the sideways scuttling by which the crab moves has proven to cause vomiting in some weak stomached summoners.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select:text;color:#111111;font-size:13px\"><em style=\"user-select:text\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li

The blistering heat of their homes fuels the fire giants' forges, and causes the iron of their fortress walls to glow a comforting orange. In lands far removed from volcanic heat, fire giants mine coal to burn. Traditional smithies occupy places of honor in their demesnes, and the giants' stony fortresses constantly belch plumes of sooty smoke. In more remote outposts, fire giants burn wood to keep their forge fires lit, deforesting leagues of land in all directions.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Fire giants shun cold as much as their cousins the frost giants hate heat. They can adapt to cold environments with effort, though, keeping their hearth fires burning bright and wearing heavy woolen clothing and furs to stay warm.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1499\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Martial Experts.</span></span> <p>From birth, a fire giant is taught to embrace a legacy of war. At the cradle, its parents chant songs of battle. As children, fire giants play at war, hurling igneous rocks at one another across the banks of magma rivers. In later years, formal martial training becomes an integral part of life in the giants' fortresses and underground realms of smoke and ash.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>The fire giants' songs are odes of battles lost and won, while their dances are martial formations of pounding feet that resound like smiths' hammers throughout their smoky halls.</p><p>Just as fire giants pass down their knowledge of crafting from generation to generation, their renowned fighting prowess comes not from wild fury but from endless discipline and training. Enemies make the mistake of underestimating fire giants based on their brutish manner, learning too late that these giants live for combat and can be shrewd tacticians.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1500\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Feudal Lords.</span></span> <p>Humanoids conquered in war become serfs to the fire giants. The serfs work the farms and fields on the outskirts of fire giant halls and fortresses, raising livestock and harvesting fields whose bounty is almost entirely tithed to the fire giant kings.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Fire giant crafters work through insight and experience rather than writing or arithmetic. Though most fire giants place little worth on such frivolousness, they sometimes keep slaves at court who are versed in such skills. Serfs not destined for court or the fields (especially dwarves) are taken to the fire giants' mountainous realms to mine ore and gemstones from deep within the earth.</p><p>Fire giants low in the ordning manage the mine tunnels and the slaves that toil there, few of which survive the difficult and dangerous work for long. Though fire giants are skilled in the engineering of mine tunnels and the gathering of ore, they place less importance on the safety of their slaves than on smelting and working the bounty those slaves produce.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1501\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Skilled Artisans.</span></span> <p>Fire giants have a fearsome reputation as soldiers and conquerors, and for their ability to burn, plunder, and destroy. Yet among the giants, fire giants produce the greatest crafters and artists. They excel at smelting and smith work, as they do at the engineering of metal and stone, and the quality of their artistry shows even in their implements of destruction and their weapons of war.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Fire giants strive to build the strongest fortresses and most potent siege weapons. They experiment with alloys to create the hardest armor, then forge the swords that can pierce it. Such work requires brawn and brains in equal measure, and fire giants high in the ordning tend to be the smartest and strongest of their kind.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1502\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Giants</span></span> <p>Ancient empires once cast long shadows over a world that quaked beneath the giants' feet. In those lost days, these towering figures were dragon slayers, dreamers, crafters, and kings, but their kind fell from glory long ago. However, even divided among secluded clans scattered throughout the world, the giants maintain the customs and traditions of old.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1503\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Old as Legend</span></span> <p>In remote regions of the world, the last remaining plinths, monoliths, and statues of the great giant empires bow their heads in desolate obscurity. Where once those empires sprawled across all lands, now the giants dwell in isolated tribes and clans.</p><p>Giants are almost as old as dragons, which were still young when the giants' heavy feet first shook the foundations of the world. As they spread across new lands, giants and dragons fought bitter generational wars that nearly brought both sides low. No living giant remembers what started the conflict, but myths and tales of their race's glorious dawn are still sung in their steadings and holdfasts, vilifying the primeval wyrms. Giants and dragons continue to harbor grudges against one another, and it is seldom that they will meet or occupy the same area without a fight.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1504\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Ordning</span></span> <p>Each of the main giant races-the cloud, fire, frost, hill, stone, and storm giants-are related by common elements of history, religion, and culture. They view one another as kindred, keeping any inherent animosity over territory and ambition to a minimum.</p><p>Giants belong to a caste structure called the ordning. Based on social class and highly organized, the ordning assigns a social rank to each giant. By understanding its place in the ordning, a giant knows which other giants are inferior or superior to it, since no two giants are equal. Each of the giant races analyzes a different combination of skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in these qualities the purpose of their lives.</p><p>At the highest level of the ordning, the races of the giants are also ranked according to status. Storm giants are the highest in the ordning, followed by cloud giants, fire giants, frost giants, stone giants, hill giants, and finally giant kin such as fomorians, ettins, and ogres.</p><p>Regardless of a giant's rank among its own race, the chief of a hill giant tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an inferior type. It isn't considered evil to disrespect or even betray a giant of another type, merely rude.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b-inset\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"1505\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Giant Gods</span></span><p>When the giants' ancient empires fell, Annam, father of all giants, forsook his children and the world. He swore never to look upon either again until the giants had returned to their glory and reclaimed their birthright as rulers of the world. As a result, giants pray not to Annam but to his divine children, along with a host of hero-deities and godly villains that make up the giants' pantheon.</p><p>Chief among these gods are the children of Annam, whose sons represent each type of giant: Stronmaus for storm giants, Memnor for cloud giants, Skoraeus Stonebones for stone giants, Thrym for frost giants, Surtur for fire giants, and Grolantor for hill giants. Not all giants automatically revere their kind's primary deity, however. Many good cloud giants refuse to worship the deceitful Memnor, and a storm giant dwelling in the icy mountains of the north might pay more homage to Thrym than Stronmaus. Other giants feel a stronger connection to Annam's daughters, who include Hiatea, the huntress and home warden; Iallanis, goddess of love and peace; and Diancastra, an impetuous and arrogant trickster.</p><p>Some giants abandon their own gods and fall prey to demon cults, paying homage to Baphomet or Kostchtchie. To worship them or any other non-giant deity is a great sin against the ordning, and almost certain to make a giant an outcast.</p><div

However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware. Be they within a city or out on the open trail, it is always wise to maintain peace with the common-folk, for they may hide a set of skills or clever information that lies deep below their simple venere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select:text;color:#111111;font-size:13px\"><em style=\"user-select:text\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li

Dwellers of the coastal urban sprawl see the armored law keepers near daily as they patrol the streets, guard our gates, inspect shipments, and of course assist (or arrest) those citizens of their fair cities. However, the guard is not only bound by the gates and ramparts of a city's walls. Be they mercenary or professional, guards are often found patrolling the roads, either to sweep away stray packs of animals or bandits, or on alert to protect precious cargo or important citizens as they travel the less settled areas of the world. Much like the bandits and cultists who we have previously discussed in this tome, guards come in all varieties. Though many may seem to be highly trained and regimented, it should be considered that most guards see no more action than a tussle on the busy streets of a market or scattering a few bandit scavengers from an upturned wagon. Guards are not all the hardened and grizzled ex-military types we think of at the upper ranks of the orders. Be observant, young adventurer, and heed the warnings of the law, for while the guards may only be a minor threat to your dastardly visions, what lays in wait in the city dungeon may not be worth the risks!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any Alignment","race":null,"type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":null,"cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 347","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"any one language (usually Common)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Guard","displayName":20,"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/dnd5e/assets/tokens/humanoid/GuardBlueM.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"Sszv7RtcmSTb65C3","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}}},"items":[{"_id":"2reHgwNJRFbhmxqA","name":"Chain Shirt","type":"equipment","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather.

You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 281","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"inst"},"target":{"value":9,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":10,"long":0,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":"1","max":"1","per":"day"},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"1d100","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell","value":""},"level":7,"school":"con","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":false,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"innate","prepared":true},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"pack":"dnd5e.spells","originalItemName":"Teleport"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/spells/runes-blue-2.jpg","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"kyarMKN0HOb1QjVb","name":"Wind Walk","type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a g⁠aseous form for the Duration, appearing as wisps of cloud.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum⁠ but instead viewed an illusion⁠, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</p>\n<p><strong>On Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p>\n<p><strong>Off Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p>\n<p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 <em>force damage</em>, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 281","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"inst"},"target":{"value":9,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":10,"long":0,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"1d100","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell","value":""},"level":7,"school":"con","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":false,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":true},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""},"spellType":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"time":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"damageType":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"concentration":{"value":null,"_deprecated":true},"ritual":{"value":null,"_deprecated":true},"prepared":{"value":null,"_deprecated":true}},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/spells/runes-magenta-3.jpg","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"S5AeLTegixmkt9DE","name":"Mind Blank","type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to <em>psychic damage</em>, any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, Divination Spells, and the Charmed condition.

little runts… they ambushed us on the trail before we’d even been made aware we’d entered their “king’s” territory.  They attacked from out of the bushes like a tidal wave of bodies crashing into our cart, all the while gibbering in their foul, snarl of a tongue.  We should have been prepared for them, I recall their weaponry was so poor one bugger was swinging half a broom handle with a small iron spike driven through; nonetheless, they overwhelmed us with their surprise attack and made off with a hefty share of the camp’s rations for the next month.<br /><em>Captain Will Freidmont of the Upper Wilds Valdyrguard.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goblins are evil creatures of diminutive stature who exist in almost every corner of the natural world as a constant yet generally manageable threat.  Hailing from a group of creatures called goblinoids (which includes bugbears and hobgoblins), the goblin is a foul humanoid measuring no larger than the average halfling.  Goblins have skin tones varying from light clay to deep chestnut brown to a sickly, acidic green, their hair is thin and greasy, and within their jaws rest cracked and sharpened teeth.  Together with their foaming fellows, goblins form loose collectives or tribes so their power can stand pronounced in numbers.  The tribal life also allows for a crude caste system to erupt from the goblin’s chaotic politics.  All goblins have something to offer to the tribe, be they foragers, slavers, or warriors.  If they cannot contribute, they die.</p>\n<p><strong>We Live in a Society. </strong> Capricious to the last, goblins crave nothing more than power and domination of all others around them by any means (including those methods dangerous to the goblin).  Those goblins who possess enough might or cleverness may ascend to the rank of Goblin Boss and command a lair consisting of several dozens goblinoid fellows.  Should ambition prove overwhelming, the boss in rare cases may subjugate nearby lairs of rival goblinoids and crown themselves a Goblin Queen/King.  It has been documented that in one particular case, Queen Greld the Gutripper was able to enslave a camp containing hundreds of orcs, then laid siege to the city of Westerholt close by and sacked the entire city.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnash and Bite, Trick and Trap.</strong> Goblins maintain some of the most chaotic lairs within the known world, and to accomplish this the goblins require a plethora of slaves.  Not always willing to murder those they plunder, goblins and their kin are known slavers, spiriting away captured humans from merchant wagons to contruct their insidious dungeons.  WIthin a goblin lair is all manner of trap: tunnels leading nowhere, narrow passages no human could pass through, arrow slits, pits lined with spikes, and of course a multitude of alarms to warn the tribe of any impending danger.  Goblins utilize chaotic placement within their lairs to throw off intruders from their hard earned loot which is kept safe within the lair’s heart.</p>\n<p><strong>And They Dance About the Flames.</strong> Goblins, though commonly thought of as greedy and stupid, leave their chaotic tendancies behind when it comes to the structure of religious worship.  They are beholden in particular to The God of the Goblins, also called They Who Lurk Beneath, who acts as chief of all other gods to the goblinoids.  This god encourages acts of violence, blind cruelty, enslaving others, as well as war amongst the enemies of the goblins.  Goblin tribes will join together in times of worship to dance, perform rituals with blood and bone, build massive bonfires, and sew chaos throughout the lair all in devotion to their evil benefactor.  Goblins, fueled by the spirit of the revelry, will then be exceedingly aggressive and volatile for the days after, raging through the surrounding area to sate the thirst of their cruel god.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry

Commoners come in all races, social classes, professions, and personalities. Be they a sly Dragonborn merchant, a boisterous Human tavern owner, or an elvish glassblower of supreme skills, the commoner befits those often outside the nobility. Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware. Be they within a city or out on the open trail, it is always wise to maintain peace with the common-folk, for they may hide a set of skills or clever information that lies deep below their simple

Here we will view the commonalities of what would be considered the “bandit” class of criminal. Be advised while reviewing this information that not all bandits should be viewed with a scornful eye. While many seek harm or riches from their quarry, others thieve to survive in a world most unfair.</p>\n<p><strong>The Good.</strong> We begin with those bandits who could be seen as “noble criminals”. These bandits consist of the most downtrodden of our nations, those citizens who have struggled through poverty and oppression to scrape out a meager existence clinging to any comfort they can grasp. Consider what would drive a person to commit something so desperate as robbery or open theft in a village street. Bandits of a nobler sort may still be selfish with their earnings, taking what they have stolen to enrich their own lives or those of immediate relations. There are some bandits, however, who seek to use their pilfered goods to improve the lives of the poorer community. Be aware that often these bandits are desperate and afraid, especially during the act of robbery. They are scared, driven to crime by poor circumstances, so they may not require violence to disperse as more often than not they will not physically harm their victims. Keep an open mind as you travel through the world young adventurer and remember that were the tables turned, you may wish for mercy for such a minor infraction.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad and Ugly.</strong> For every good-hearted soul stealing from those with too much and giving to the unfortunate, there is a truly villainous spirit lurking behind the brush of a nearby road, lying in wait for an unsuspecting victim. During your travels, adventurer, these sorts may be the most common instances of banditry you will experience. Armed with swords, clubs, and bows, the more nefarious of the bandit world prefer to ambush their prey from the shadows of hills and trees, catching traveling parties unaware. These treacherous thieves will attempt diversion and trickery in order to catch their quarry off guard should their crew be outnumbered. Bandits have no boundaries of borders or locale, so caution should be taken whether you walk upon a forested road or sail the high seas as you island hop for fame.

I strayed from my mentor, a priest in his middle years with a soft voice and ring of grey-dappled hair about a balding head, to approach a statue set aside within a shadowed alcove.  It depicted our god in his humanoid form, an elderly man standing strictly at attention, his wild hair hanging as long as his chest length beard, a staff topped with a stern faced sun clutched in his hand.  I knelt, still only fourteen, before this statue and began to pray right then.  The next six years of my acolyte training would be nothing but a blessing, I knew. <br /><em>“The Gleaming Star”, by Bishop Bernard Portis.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Acolytes are those devoted followers of a particular goddess or god who have decided to take on the mantle of the clergy to better serve their chosen deity.  Often no older than teenagers (though some acolytes begin later in their lives) acolytes are trained for a number of years (typically between three to ten) depending on the strictures of their deity’s doctrines.  During their time they memorize and study all written materials concerning their deity and their teachings, learn magics (be they healing or harmful) gifted to the acolytes by their deities, and often go out into their community to provide aid to those in need or proselytize the words of their goddess or god.  Though not every acolyte climbs the ranks into full fledged priesthood, many remain highly dedicated to the church and remain to serve as life-long acolytes working closely with the lay community outside the temple walls.</p>\n<p>Recall that acolytes are trained in the arcane ways of their chosen deities.  This being the case, acolytes rarely receive sufficient martial training in comparison to the paladin ranks of the temple (unless expressly dictated otherwise by their deity’s teachings).  This being the case, the acolyte is able to unleash some basic divine magic in order to both defend themselves and allies or to call upon their patron deity for aid for injured parties.  Typically expelled in a gleaming shower of golden sparks and dazzlingly vibrant lights, the magic of the gods is truly something special, even at such a base nature.  Spells such as Cure Wounds, Sacred Flame, or Sanctuary are all practiced by acolytes early on into their divine studies.  Acolytes can make handy allies should you be in need of divine protection or a field medic for an injured compatriot.  Be sure to mind your acolyte well, however, as their spellwork can easily be interrupted if they are forced into a melee fight with a band of slavering gnolls.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;font-size:13px;color:#111111\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\"><em

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum⁠ but instead viewed an illusion⁠, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</p><p><strong>On Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p><p><strong>Off Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 281","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"inst"},"target":{"value":9,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":10,"long":0,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":1,"max":"1","per":"day"},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"1d100","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell","value":""},"level":7,"school":"con","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":false,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"innate","prepared":true},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"effects":[],"folder":"6NbznYnWojECA37q","sort":300000,"permission":{"default":0,"waKYZcTsEeBIh5Fa":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.spells.L4J89JXqbKs6puEV"}}},{"_id":"N9GGWtiNW4wavRJA","name":"Multiattack","type":"feat","img":"icons/skills/melee/strike-weapons-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The devil makes two scimitar attacks.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"0","per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":"XWez243gX0YtzU9y","sort":3400000,"permission":{"default":0,"waKYZcTsEeBIh5Fa":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.monsterfeatures.EqoLg8T8EHvhJgKE"}}},{"_id":"HDr0UIVors97sB3r","name":"Scimitar","type":"weapon","img":"icons/weapons/swords/sword-katana.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

Smiler thinks he can accomplish anything with a positive attitude and some death-defying stunt. Although he admits others might end up getting killed by his actions, he believes he can bend the multiverse to his whims if he tries hard enough. He’s really quite insane.</p>\n<p>One of Smiler’s favorite antics is to use a hallucinatory terrain spell to create a little bit of the Feywild in Avernus: a beautiful woodland glade in which to lose himself for a few hours while he meditates and plots.</p>\n<p>This eladrin adventurer from the Feywild became stranded in Avernus after his companions abandoned him. He has spent the past seventy years roaming Avernus, making deals with fiends to survive. Smiler eventually sold his soul to a pit fiend, who gave him the means to topple a nycaloth warlord named Yarrasto. Smiler took control of the nycaloth’s warband and their infernal war machines.

In their humanoid and hybrid forms, they use heavy weapons, while in hybrid or animal form, they gain a devastating goring attack through which their curse is spread.

In its natural humanoid form, a creature cursed by lycanthropy appears as its normal self. Over time, however, many lycanthropes acquire features suggestive of their animal form. In that animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of a normal animal. On close inspection, its eyes show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence and might glow red in the dark.</p><p>Evil lycanthropes hide among normal folk, emerging in animal form at night to spread terror and bloodshed, especially under a full moon.

By resisting the curse, a lycanthrope retains its normal alignment and personality while in humanoid form. It lives its life as it always has, burying deep the bestial urges raging inside it. However, when the full moon rises, the curse becomes too strong to resist, transforming the individual into its beast form-or into a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and humanoid traits. When the moon wanes, the beast within can be controlled once again. Especially if the cursed creature is unaware of its condition, it might not remember the events of its transformation, though those memories often haunt a lycanthrope as bloody dreams.</p><p>Some individuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept what they are. With time and experience, they learn to master their shapechanging ability and can assume beast form or hybrid form at will. Most lycanthropes that embrace their bestial natures succumb to bloodlust, becoming evil, opportunistic creatures that prey on the weak.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b-inset\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"2824\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Player Characters as Lycanthropes</span></span><p>A character who becomes a lycanthrope retains his or her statistics except as specified by lycanthrope type.

As much as they enjoy enslaving others, the dao hate being enslaved. Powerful wizards have been known to lure dao to the Material Plane and trap them in the confines of magic gemstones or iron flasks. Unfortunately for the dao, their greed makes it relatively easy for mages to cozen them into service.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1220\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Genies.</span></span> <p>Genies are rare elemental creatures out of story and legend. Only a few can be found on the Material Plane. The rest reside on the Elemental Planes, where they rule from lavish palaces and are attended by worshipful slaves.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Genies are as brilliant as they are mighty, as proud as they are majestic. Haughty and decadent, they have a profound sense of entitlement that stems from the knowledge that few creatures except the gods and other genies can challenge their power.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1221\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creatures of the Elements.</span></span> <p> A genie is born when the soul of a sentient living creature melds with the primordial matter of an elemental plane. Only under rare circumstances does such an elemental-infused soul coalesce into a manifest form and create a genie.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A genie usually retains no connection to the soul that gave it form. That life force is a building block that determines the genie's form and apparent gender, as well as one or two key personality traits. Although they resemble humanoid beings, genies are elemental spirits given physical form. They don't mate with other genies or produce genie offspring, as all new genies are born out of the same mysterious fusion of spirit energy and elemental power. A genie with a stronger connection to its mortal soul might choose to sire a child with a mortal, although such offspring are rare.</p><p>When a genie perishes, it leaves nothing behind except what it was wearing or carrying, along with a small trace of its native element: a pile of dust, a gust of wind, a flash of fire and smoke, or a burst of water and foam.</p><p>In contrast to their love of slaves, most genies loathe being bound to service themselves. A genie obeys the will of another only when bribed or compelled by magic. All genies command the power of their native element, but a rare few also possess the power to grant wishes. For both these reasons, mortal mages often seek to bind genies into service.</p><p>Noble genies cultivate the jealousy and envy of other genies, asserting their superiority at every opportunity. Other genies respect the influence of the noble genies, knowing how unwise it is to defy a creature that can alter reality at a whim. A genie isn't beholden to any noble genie, however, and will sometimes choose to defy a noble genie's will and risk the consequences.</p><p>Their miraculous powers, the grandeur of their abodes, and the numbers of their slaves allow some genies to deceive themselves into believing they are as powerful as the gods. Some go so far as to demand that mortals of other realms-even whole continents or worlds-bow down before them.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1222\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Rule or Be Ruled.</span></span> <p> Mortal slaves serve to validate a genie's power and high self-opinion. A hundred flattering voices are music to a genie's ears, while two hundred mortal slaves prostrated at its feet are proof that it is lord and master. Genies view slaves as living property, and a genie without property amounts to nothing among its own kind. As a result, many genies treasure their slaves, treating them as honored members of their households. Evil genies freely threaten and abuse their slaves, but never to the extent that the slaves are no longer of use.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1223\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Decadent Nobility.</span></span> <p> Noble genies are the rarest of their kind. They are used to getting what they want, and have learned to trade their ability to grant wishes to attain the objects of their desire. This constant indulgence has made them decadent, while their supreme power over reality makes them haughty and arrogant. Their vast palaces overflow with wonders and sensory delights beyond imagination.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1224\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Power of Worship.</span></span> <p> Genies acknowledge the gods as powerful entities but have no desire to court or worship them.

Here we will view the commonalities of what would be considered the “bandit” class of criminal. Be advised while reviewing this information that not all bandits should be viewed with a scornful eye. While many seek harm or riches from their quarry, others thieve to survive in a world most unfair.</p>\n<p><strong>The Good.</strong> We begin with those bandits who could be seen as “noble criminals”. These bandits consist of the most downtrodden of our nations, those citizens who have struggled through poverty and oppression to scrape out a meager existence clinging to any comfort they can grasp. Consider what would drive a person to commit something so desperate as robbery or open theft in a village street. Bandits of a nobler sort may still be selfish with their earnings, taking what they have stolen to enrich their own lives or those of immediate relations. There are some bandits, however, who seek to use their pilfered goods to improve the lives of the poorer community. Be aware that often these bandits are desperate and afraid, especially during the act of robbery. They are scared, driven to crime by poor circumstances, so they may not require violence to disperse as more often than not they will not physically harm their victims. Keep an open mind as you travel through the world young adventurer and remember that were the tables turned, you may wish for mercy for such a minor infraction.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad and Ugly.</strong> For every good-hearted soul stealing from those with too much and giving to the unfortunate, there is a truly villainous spirit lurking behind the brush of a nearby road, lying in wait for an unsuspecting victim. During your travels, adventurer, these sorts may be the most common instances of banditry you will experience. Armed with swords, clubs, and bows, the more nefarious of the bandit world prefer to ambush their prey from the shadows of hills and trees, catching traveling parties unaware. These treacherous thieves will attempt diversion and trickery in order to catch their quarry off guard should their crew be outnumbered.

Xvarts also form alliances with wererats, although the lycanthropes are dominant in any such arrangement. This relationship traces back to Raxivort’s divine nature. Even though the xvarts inherited Raxivort’s greed and cowardice, they also gained his ability to form bonds with such creatures.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><em><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Xvart Warlocks.</span> </strong></em>A xvart can forge a pact with Raxivort by stealing an item of such great value that the demigod himself appears before the xvart to claim it. After surrendering the item to Raxivort, the xvart asks for magical power so that it can find and deliver more great treasures into Raxivort’s custody. If the demigod feels so inclined, he imbues the xvart with greater wisdom and charisma and grants it the spellcasting abilities of a warlock before returning to the howling chaos of Pandemonium. Raxivort’s warlocks are respected and feared in xvart society, but they have little interest in political power. They scour the wilderness, old ruins, and dungeons for treasures, often with a handful of xvart sycophants and giant rat bodyguards in tow.</p>"},"alignment":"chaotic evil","race":"xvart","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"hill, underdark","cr":1,"spellLevel":3,"xp":{"value":200,"xp":{"value":200}},"source":"Volo's Guide to Monsters, pg. 200","gender":"","age":"","height":"","weight":"","eyes":"","skin":"","hair":"","notes1name":"","notes2name":"","notes3name":"","notes4name":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["abyssal"],"custom":""},"perception":{"value":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14,"prof":0,"total":4},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14,"prof":0,"total":4},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14,"prof":0,"total":4},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14,"prof":0,"total":4},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ste":{"value":0.5,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":13,"prof":1,"total":3},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":4},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":2},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Xvart Warlock of Raxivort","displayName":0,"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5ea49b1dd9775962e6288461/Tokens/vince_ka_ren.Token.webp?1631661278641","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":30,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"URyM4bdaKZDkhVKB","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}}},"items":[{"_id":"JNt12VqPWVPStxLX","name":"Innate Spellcasting","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><span data-type=\"subtitle\">The xvart's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma.

As I peered into the first circle of the Nine Hells I did spy the quarry of my search with relative ease, The Maggot Pit. Here, deep within the valley of a parched and cracking mountain range lay a pit perhaps a mile in diameter, flanked all around by devilish guards. Within the milky pit writhed millions of ghostly pale worms, biting and squirming beneath their fellows. It was here that the lowly devils did bring up cart after cart piled high with the wretched and weakened souls of the pitiful dead, who were unceremoniously prodded to the edge of the pit and thrown within the writhing “waters” below. The sight of the lamentable being that emerged from that pool haunts my visions to this very day… <br /><em>- Alaband the Curious, Mage in the Circle of the Constellar.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wretched and foul, the Lemure is perhaps the weakest being to emerge shrieking from the Nine Hells into our plane of existence. Lemures resemble nothing more than a living ooze which has attempted to take the form of something vaguely humanoid. A malformed head with humanoid features sits atop the puddle of a creature, its pink and rotting flesh slithering beneath two stunted arms. Only able to cry out incoherently, the Lemure acts at the whim of its infernal masters, reduced in this form to a babbling fool. These creatures are the first troops sent through to another plane as the infantry in a never ending war which the Archdevils of the Nine Hells wage upon their foes. Though the Lemure has nearly no will of its own, the creature does have the strength to return to life should it be killed within its home of the Nine Hells. Be sure to pack a fair portion of holy water or utilize a Bless incantation should you slay on of these beasts in the realm of the devils, lest it only return to life within the Maggot Pit a few days

At first, new redcaps look like tiny, bloodstained mushrooms just pushing their caps out of the soil. When moonlight shines on one of these caps, a creature that looks like a wizened and undersized gnome with a hunched back and a sinewy frame springs from the earth. The creature has a pointed leather cap, pants of similar material, heavy iron boots, and a heavy bladed weapon. From the moment it awakens, a redcap desires only murder and carnage, and it sets out to satisfy these cravings. Even if a redcap wanted to be stealthy, its iron boots force it to take ponderous, thunderous steps.</p>\n<p>To sustain its unnatural existence, a redcap must soak its hat in the fresh blood of its victims. If the blood isn’t replenished at least once every three days, the redcap vanishes as if it had never been. A redcap’s desire to slay is rooted in its will to survive.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>VARIANT: MADCAPS</strong></p>\n<p>A madcap is a redcap that soaks its hat in demon ichor instead of blood. Contact with demon ichor makes the creature even more psychotic, causing it to brood over irrational hatreds.

Nobles can run the gamut of humanoid races, so long as these folks have the wealth to back up their claim to a noble title. Not all nobles are born into wealth however; in rare cases nobles may earn their status by dedicated work to the lords of their regions or by simply having titles given to them via friends finding themselves in positions of power. Through all of the perfume and powders adorning a noble's body, no stink is so ever present as that of corruption wafting just below the flowery mask.</p>\n<p><strong>Entourage.</strong> Nobles rarely travel alone outside of their massive estates, prefering to be flanked by a retinue of trained bodyguards and faithful servants. This should always be kept in mind when dealing with nobles; there is never simply the nobleman/woman alone beyond their estate walls. Should a brigand be fearsome enough to make it through the noble's well-paid defenses, the monied elite is certainly a force to be reckoned with. Noble-birthed children receive some of the finest martial training in the land from an early age and are well equipped to strike back with sword or rapier. Keep an eye on your own footwork should you misstep and leave yourself open to a noble's well practiced parry.

in poisons: Check.  Beholden to ancient evils: Check.  Can see you in the dark: Check.  Now let me ask you this… why are you wanting to go stir up a nest of Drow?<br /><strong>- a subterranean guide.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Drow were once the very same elves of the woods and cities we are more commonly aware of; however, a schism within the belief structures of various elvish factions forced a sect of elvenkind to flee below the surface of the world and take refuge within the massive subterranean caverns they found there.  Within the caves their skin darkened to a deep pitch black and their hair faded to shades of white and silver.  These elves, thin and regal in posture, became known as simply the Drow.  As centuries passed beneath the world’s crust, the Drow adapted to their new surroundings in notable ways.</p>\n<p><strong>You Think the Darkness is your Ally?</strong> The Drow’s elven eyes, once adapted to see for miles in the bright sunlight, grew pale without the nourishment of the light and transformed into orbs keen at seeing anything within the pitch darkness of the underground.  Drow have also learned to use the darkness to their advantage and may even creep to the surface world under the cover of night’s shadows to carry out raids upon villages nearby.  This adaptation has not come without cost, however, as the Drow’s skin and eyes can no longer stand the burning sun.  This forces the dark elves to utilize the night or sufficiently cover themselves to avoid the sun’s glare.  Drow do still retain some of their elvish arcane abilities as they may not be charmed or forced to sleep by spellwork.  Many Drow females (as Drows exist in a matriarchy) are also skilled sorcerers and priestesses who primarily choose to side with gods on the more sinister side of the pantheon.  Other clever Drow have worked out methods of distilling certain poisons from underground mushrooms and creatures who lurk upon the cavern walls.  These toxins are well known amongst connoisseurs of poisons for both their availability as well as their legendary potency.  It is not uncommon for all soldiers in a Drow army to be equipped with at least one vial of

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum⁠ but instead viewed an illusion⁠, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</p><p><strong>On Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p><p><strong>Off Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 281","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"inst"},"target":{"value":9,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":10,"long":0,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"1d100","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell","value":""},"level":7,"school":"con","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":false,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":true},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"sort":3100000,"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"pack":"dnd5e.spells","originalItemName":"Teleport"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/spells/runes-blue-2.jpg","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}}],"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"fgFDoSxXJx3CigMr":3},"flags":{"dnd5e":{},"monsterMunch":{"url":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/blue-abishai","img":"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/268/73/400/523/636597517365330365.png","tokenImg":"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/268/72/636597517359714320.jpeg","spellList":{"class":["chromatic orb","disguise self","expeditious retreat","magic missile","charm person","thunderwave","darkness","mirror image","misty step","dispel magic","fear","lightning bolt","dimension door","greater invisibility","ice storm","cone of cold","wall of force","chain lightning","teleport"],"pact":[],"atwill":["friends","mage hand","message","minor illusion","shocking grasp"],"innate":[],"edgeCases":[]}},"ddbimporter":{"id":94561,"entityTypeId":779871897,"creatureGroup":null,"creatureFlags":[]},"betterNpcSheet":{"sheet":{"height":881,"width":900}},"core":{"sourceId":"Actor.9HjC51R0fZJGydzz"},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"Actor.9HjC51R0fZJGydzz","hash":"abcc95982e8989f5c671db47dee4c5ad0238d910"},"cf":{"id":"temp_2tcdbt87ily"}}}

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum⁠ but instead viewed an illusion⁠, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</p><p><strong>On Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p><p><strong>Off Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area.

Cultists, as their name describes, are those members of a secret underground society (or cult) whom very often practice a dark and unholy religion with their fellows. Beware adventurer! Not every cult is simply based around religious pretexts, there are those who seek political movements, those who are power hungry, and those who deign to meddle with forces our histories have lost long ago. Let me describe for you the very basics of common cult activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Friends on the Other Side.</strong> Cultists operate entirely in secrecy outside of the normal comings and goings of everyday life. What makes the cultist so fascinating is that they often attempt to blend seamlessly in with common folk: the barkeep at your favorite tavern, the guard near the gate, or even the dancer upon the stage may all be part of an underground community based ostensibly in evil. Now, to be clear, I do not encourage paranoia as cult activity is relatively rare in comparison to other, more immediate threats to our world; however, should a clever adventurer keep a keen eye out for secretive motions or gestures, odd symbols or markings, and even whispered code words, they can be certain they have stumbled into the workings of a cult. Quite commonly cultists align themselves with an ancient power trapped or dormant somewhere upon one of the more foul planes of existence. Their goals with this dark, godly force are myriad but often include control of a political structure, the deaths of hundreds if not thousands, or simply to sew despair and chaos across the realms of mortals. Unlike the desperate and cowardly bandits pushed to the brink by circumstance, cultists are often irredeemable foes. These men and women have been programed, brain-washed, or even directly controlled by their benefactor into the ways of darkness; often they are unfortunately unable to return to society once they have ingratiated themselves too deeply within the cult's network. Cults should always be handled and broken up with the utmost care; though the humanoid pawns behind the cult can be more easily dealt with, it should be remembered that cosmically evil forces may be at work and already set well into motion behind those pawns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope
